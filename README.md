## FAQ

- Why is it named discord-**node**ify when it runs on Deno?

> This project started out being written for nodejs.
I began learning Deno around the same time,
and I quickly fell in love.
Since the project was still in the early stages of development,
I decided to switch it over to Deno.
>
> I didn't change the name because I liked it,
and I found it funny that is wasn't written for nodejs dispite node being in the name.

- Why is there a `package.json` file when this is written for Deno?

> While deno does have `deno lint`, it doesn't cover all the rules I use, mainly style related rules,
> so I still use [eslint](https://eslint.org).
